# dd_agent_slack_check

A custom agent check that (so far) can report on the number of posts in a Slack channel that havenâ€™t had a reply and average post response times in a channel for the past 24 hours.  It can also produce events to be used as posts back to the originating channel effectively "bumping" the unanswered posts by listing hyperlinks back to those threads.  The main goal being, that we can use it to alert (perhaps checking hourly) if any of the channels have stale/missed posts in them.

This will help teams learn how effective they are at helping one another over Slack.  It will also be a tool to help people recognize and respond to gaps in the discussions over Slack so that fewer questions/issues go unanswered.

big dreams: I also think it could potentially be a useful customer facing integration if it's polished and fully featured.  Though for that scenario it might be best as a crawler or credential based integration.
